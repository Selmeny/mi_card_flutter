# My Business Card App
My first simple flutter project used as a challenge for The App Brewery. This project mainly worked on UI customization.

Here are the main things that i learned to use in this project:

* How to create Stateless Widgets
* What is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold
* How to use Containers to lay out your UI
* How to use Columns and Rows to position your UI elements
* How to add custom fonts
* How to add Material icons
* How to style Text widgets
* How to read and use Flutter Documentation
